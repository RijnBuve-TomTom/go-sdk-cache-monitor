### Time Machine Slider — Design & Implementation Decisions Scratchpad

> **Purpose:** After completing each task, record the most important design and implementation decisions that affect subsequent tasks. This serves as a living record of context, trade-offs, and guidance for the next steps.

---

#### After Task 1 (EventStore module)

_Record here: key decisions about data structure choices, performance trade-offs, API surface, and anything that impacts Tasks 2–7._

- [x] **Data structure:** Flat `TileBatchMessage[]` array, appended in chronological order. Simple and sufficient for the expected 2-minute retention window.
- [x] **API surface:** `add`, `getEventsUpTo`, `getTimeRange`, `prune`, `size`, `clear` — exactly as planned. No deviations.
- [x] **`getEventsUpTo` uses `Array.filter()`** — O(n) linear scan. Acceptable for a 2-minute window at typical event rates. If performance becomes an issue in Task 6 (replay), a binary search on the sorted `time` field could be added, but premature optimization isn't warranted now.
- [x] **Chronological insertion assumed:** `add()` does not sort; it trusts that batches arrive in order (guaranteed by the server's streaming order). `getTimeRange()` relies on this by reading first/last elements.
- [x] **`prune()` takes explicit `now` and `maxAgeMs`** rather than using `Date.now()` internally — keeps the module pure and testable. Caller (main.ts in Task 5) will pass `Date.now()` and `120_000`.
- [x] **No deviations from the plan.** Implementation matches the plan exactly.

#### After Task 2 (TimeCursor state module)

_Record here: decisions about state management approach, callback design, snap threshold rationale, and anything that impacts Tasks 3–7._

- [x] **State representation:** Boolean `live` flag + numeric `cursorTime`. Starts in live mode (`live = true`, `cursorTime = 0`). Simple and sufficient — no enum or state machine needed.
- [x] **Callback-based notification:** Constructor takes a single `TimeCursorChangeCallback` that fires on every `setTime()` and `goLive()` call with `{ isLive, time }`. This decouples the cursor from DOM/UI — the callback in Task 5 will handle map rebuilds and UI updates.
- [x] **Snap threshold:** 500ms (`SNAP_THRESHOLD_MS`). Uses `Math.abs(time - now)` so it works for both dragging from the left (past) toward now and edge cases. When snapping, `cursorTime` is set to `now` (not the raw drag time) for clean state.
- [x] **`setTime(time, now)` takes explicit `now` parameter** — same pure/testable pattern as EventStore's `prune()`. Caller passes `Date.now()` or `latestNow` from the slider tick. This keeps the module deterministic in tests.
- [x] **`goLive(now)` is unconditional** — always sets `live = true` and fires callback, even if already live. This simplifies the "Go Live" button wiring in Task 7 (no need to check current state first).
- [x] **Exported types:** `TimeCursorState` interface and `TimeCursorChangeCallback` type are exported for use by TimelineSlider (Task 4) and main.ts (Task 5).
- [x] **No deviations from the plan.** Implementation and tests match the plan exactly.

#### After Task 3 (Timeline slider HTML and CSS)

_Record here: decisions about DOM structure, CSS variable usage, layout positioning relative to the rate chart, and anything that impacts Tasks 4–7._

- [x] **DOM structure:** Slider inserted directly after the `<canvas id="rate-chart">` inside `<section id="charts">`, before the Hit Ratio chart. Structure is `#timeline-slider > .timeline-track > (.timeline-elapsed + .timeline-thumb)` plus `.timeline-labels` with three spans (start, cursor, end).
- [x] **Element IDs for Task 4/5 wiring:** `timeline-slider` (container), `timeline-elapsed` (filled portion), `timeline-thumb` (draggable indicator), `timeline-label-start`, `timeline-label-cursor`, `timeline-label-end`. Task 4's `TimelineSliderElements` interface expects `track`, `thumb`, `elapsed`, `labelCursor` — all present.
- [x] **CSS custom properties:** Uses existing `:root` variables — `--bg-card` (track background), `--border` (track border), `--green` (live state color), `--red` (historical state color via `.historical` class), `--text-dim` (label color), `--font` (label font). No new CSS variables introduced.
- [x] **Historical state toggling:** `.historical` class is defined for `.timeline-elapsed`, `.timeline-thumb`, and `.timeline-label-cursor` — switches color from green to red. Task 4's `updatePosition()` will toggle this class via `classList.add/remove`.
- [x] **Thumb uses `▼` arrow character** (`<span class="timeline-thumb-arrow">▼</span>`) styled with `drop-shadow` filter for visibility against the dark background. Positioned with `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` for center-alignment on the track.
- [x] **No deviations from the plan.** Implementation matches the plan exactly.

#### After Task 4 (TimelineSlider interaction module)

_Record here: decisions about pointer event handling, coordinate-to-time mapping, touch support approach, and anything that impacts Tasks 5–7._

- [x] **Pointer event handling:** Separate mouse (`mousedown`/`mousemove`/`mouseup`) and touch (`touchstart`/`touchmove`/`touchend`) listeners. `mousedown` and `touchstart` are on the thumb element; `mousemove`/`mouseup` and `touchmove`/`touchend` are on `document` so dragging continues even when the pointer leaves the thumb. Track click also triggers `handlePointerMove` for jump-to-position.
- [x] **Coordinate-to-time mapping:** `handlePointerMove(clientX)` computes a fraction `(clientX - rect.left) / rect.width` clamped to [0, 1], then maps it to `rangeStart + frac * timeRangeMs` where `rangeStart = latestNow - timeRangeMs`. Calls `cursor.setTime(time, latestNow)` which handles snap-to-live via the 500ms threshold.
- [x] **Tick/animation strategy:** `tick(now)` updates `latestNow` and calls `updatePosition()` only when in live mode. Caller (main.ts in Task 5) will invoke this from the existing 1-second `setInterval`. No `requestAnimationFrame` loop needed — 1s granularity is sufficient for the slider position.
- [x] **Visual state toggling:** `updatePosition()` toggles `.historical` class on thumb, elapsed bar, and cursor label — matching the CSS classes defined in Task 3. Label shows "● LIVE" (green) or negative seconds like "-30s" (red).
- [x] **TimelineSliderElements interface:** Expects `{ track, thumb, elapsed, labelCursor }` — Task 5 will query these by ID from the DOM elements created in Task 3.
- [x] **Default time range:** 60,000ms (60s) matching the rate chart window. `setTimeRange(ms)` allows changing it if needed.
- [x] **No deviations from the plan.** Implementation matches the plan exactly. No tests required for this module per plan (it's DOM-dependent; wiring and visual verification happen in Task 5).

#### After Task 5 (Wire EventStore and TimeCursor into main.ts)

_Record here: decisions about integration points, gating logic for live vs historical mode, interval timing, and anything that impacts Tasks 6–7._

- [x] **Integration points:** Three new imports (`EventStore`, `TimeCursor`, `TimelineSlider`) added after the `tile-map` import. Four new DOM refs (`$timelineTrack`, `$timelineThumb`, `$timelineElapsed`, `$timelineLabelCursor`) added after the existing DOM refs block. Time machine state block placed between hit ratio history and formatters sections.
- [x] **Gating logic in `handleTileBatch`:** Feed items, rate counters (`currentSecondBuckets`), and total event count always update regardless of mode — keeping the feed, rate chart, and counters live. `eventStore.add(msg)` always stores for replay. `addTileEventsToMap` is only called when `timeCursor.isLive()` is true — this is the sole gate that freezes the map in historical mode.
- [x] **`rebuildMapFromStore` approach:** Calls `clearTiles()` then replays all batches via `addTileEventsToMap` in a loop. This is the simple/correct approach for Task 5. Task 6 will replace this with the more efficient `replayTileEventsToMap` that batches all tile updates before a single map source update, avoiding N source updates for N batches.
- [x] **TimeCursor callback:** Wired directly in the constructor — calls `rebuildMapFromStore(Infinity)` on live resume, `rebuildMapFromStore(state.time)` on historical scrub. This fires on every `setTime()` and `goLive()` call.
- [x] **Prune and tick in setInterval:** Both `eventStore.prune(Date.now(), 120_000)` and `timelineSlider.tick(Date.now())` added to the existing 1-second interval at the end, after rate chart and events/sec updates. 1-second granularity is sufficient for slider position advancement and store cleanup.
- [x] **No deviations from the plan.** Implementation matches the plan exactly.

#### After Task 6 (Efficient replayTileEventsToMap)

_Record here: decisions about replay performance, map source update batching, max tile enforcement, and anything that impacts Task 7._

- [x] **Replay performance strategy:** `replayTileEventsToMap` clears `trackedTiles` and `removeAllDialogs()` first (no map source update), then replays all batches into the in-memory `trackedTiles` map, and only updates `SOURCE_ID` and `CROSS_SOURCE_ID` GeoJSON sources once at the end. This avoids N source updates for N batches — the key performance win over the Task 5 approach.
- [x] **`trackedTiles.clear()` interaction:** The function directly clears the module-level `trackedTiles` map and calls `removeAllDialogs()` without triggering a map source update (unlike `clearTiles()` which does update sources). This is intentional — the single source update at the end covers both the clear and the replay.
- [x] **MAX_TILES enforcement during replay:** After replaying all batches, the same oldest-first eviction logic from `addTileEventsToMap` is applied. Tiles are sorted by `addedAt` (which is set to `batch.time` during replay, not `Date.now()`) and the oldest are removed to stay under `MAX_TILES`.
- [x] **`addedAt` uses `batch.time` (not `Date.now()`):** During replay, `addedAt` is set to the batch's original timestamp. This is correct for historical replay — tiles are ordered by when they originally appeared, not when the replay ran. This differs from `addTileEventsToMap` which uses `Date.now()` for live updates.
- [x] **Auto-zoom during replay:** `fitMapToTiles()` is called once at the end if `autoZoomEnabled` is true, same as `addTileEventsToMap`. This means scrubbing the timeline will re-fit the map to the visible tiles at that point in time.
- [x] **`rebuildMapFromStore` simplified:** Now just calls `eventStore.getEventsUpTo(cutoffMs)` + `replayTileEventsToMap(batches)` — no more `clearTiles()` + loop. The `clearTiles` import is still needed for the "Clear Tiles" menu action.
- [x] **No deviations from the plan.** Implementation matches the plan exactly.

#### After Task 7 (Visual polish and edge cases)

_Record here: final decisions about edge case handling, Go Live button behavior, tooltip formatting, and any remaining follow-ups or known limitations._

- [x] **Empty event store guard:** Added `if (this.timeRangeMs <= 0) return;` at the top of `TimelineSlider.updatePosition()`. If the time range is zero or negative (e.g., just loaded, no events yet), the thumb stays at the right edge and no position calculations are attempted — prevents NaN/Infinity from zero-division.
- [x] **"Go Live" button:** Added `<button id="timeline-go-live">` inside `#timeline-slider`, positioned absolutely at top-right. Styled with green border/text matching `--green` CSS variable, with `rgba(52,211,153,0.15)` background and hover darkening. Visibility toggled via `.hidden` class in the `TimeCursor` onChange callback — shown when historical, hidden when live.
- [x] **Go Live click handler:** Calls `timeCursor.goLive(Date.now())` then `timelineSlider.updatePosition()` to snap back to live immediately. The `goLive()` call fires the onChange callback which hides the button and rebuilds the map with `Infinity` cutoff.
- [x] **Thumb tooltip:** `title` attribute updated dynamically in `updatePosition()` — shows "Live — drag to travel in time" when live, or `toLocaleTimeString("en-US", { hour12: false })` (e.g., "14:23:05") when in historical mode.
- [x] **Slider clamping (Step 4):** Not implemented — per plan's suggestion, users can drag freely beyond the event store range. Dragging before the first stored event simply results in an empty map, which is acceptable behavior and avoids coupling the slider to the EventStore.
- [x] **No deviations from the plan.** All steps implemented exactly as specified. No new tests needed — this task is pure UI/DOM work verified visually.
